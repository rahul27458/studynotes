  h2 About StudyNotes

  p At StudyNotes, we are building the best and simplest learning tools to empower students to accelerate their learning &ndash; i.e. to learn more effectively, in a shorter time, and with better long-term recall.
  p We believe that the educational process can be massively accelerated &ndash; students shouldn't need to spend 15 years in a classroom before they're useful to society! We want to help every student learn faster so they can contribute more useful art, science, and technology to society over their lifetime.
  p Currently, StudyNotes offers the best Advanced Placement* study guides, practice tests, and notes on the web, contributed and curated by students and teachers like yourself. <strong>The site is used by millions of students in all 50 U.S. states</strong> to prepare for AP* courses and exams.

  p StudyNotes was started in 2006 by <a href="http://feross.org">Feross Aboukhadijeh</a> when he was a high school junior in order to share his class notes with his classmates and the world.
  p Feross is currently 22 years old and has a BS in computer science from <a href="http://stanford.edu">Stanford University</a> and is currently working towards earning his MS. Feross is a web developer, designer, computer security researcher, teacher, long distance runner, gamer, and music lover.
  p In the past, Feross has worked at <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>, and <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a>.
