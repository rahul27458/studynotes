  h2 Plagiarism is Unethical

  p Students are NOT encouraged to pass off material found on this website as their own work. <strong>StudyNotes does NOT condone plagiarism in any way, shape, or form.</strong>

  p For example, if you read one of our <a href="/english/sample-essays/">sample AP English essays</a> and get some ideas to use in your own essay, then you should cite StudyNotes. Don't try to take credit for someone else's ideas &ndash; this is plagiarism.

  p Plagiarizing work has real and dire consequences. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;q=plagiarism+scandal">Every few months</a> there's a huge scandal where some author, journalist, or scientist gets called out for plagiarising someone else's work. They often lose their job or get kicked out of their university. Plagiarism is serious business.
